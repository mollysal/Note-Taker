# Note-Taker
Module 11 - Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to create a Note Taking application that can write & save notes. It uses Express.js in the back end & it needs to save & retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

The applicationâ€™s front end was already created. The goal of this assignment was to build the back end & connect the two.

User Story: 
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```
